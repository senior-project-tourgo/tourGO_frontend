# Welcome to tourGO app Frontend 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## What is TourGO
TourGO: A gamified tourism mobile application for Nepal to enhance visitor experiences in cultural destinations through interactive and personalized curated travel experiences.

This is a monorepo-based application project structured for scalability and future backend expansion.

This repository is organized as a **frontend repo**. The frontend is already set up with modern mobile development tools, while the backend is intentionally left open for future decisions.

## 📱 Frontend

The **frontend** is a mobile application built with a modern, developer-friendly stack:

* **React Native** – cross-platform mobile development
* **Expo** – streamlined development, build, and deployment

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can run the app using:

* Expo Go (QR code)
* iOS Simulator
* Android Emulator

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Finalize backend architecture
* Connect frontend to API
* Improve documentation and developer experience
